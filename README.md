What began as adding insulation to rooftop ducts of HVAC units and modifying building use is now daily monitoring average temperature and monthly energy use.

This is about how to apply what I learned about remote data access during COVID-19 to get local temperature data and energy use for model fitting and improvement. Three workbooks were created to track the data. I have yet to learn how to do this.

The first was manually gathering the information from the National Weather Service and NV Energy and putting them together to form an initial model for heating and cooling power consumption according to average billing period temperature.

The second came shortly after this as NV Energy sends weekly text updates of the current charges, the days left in billing period, and the expected bill at the end of that period. I was curious to know what method they are using to predict that number.

Finally, after last winter was over, I sought to test the model against the new seasons' data. 

Below are PDFs of the three workbooks to date. OK. No PDFs. Excel files? Open Document Format, of course! Nope. CSV? Huh. No. What kind of files?
